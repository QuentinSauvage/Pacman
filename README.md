# Pacman
This game was made during my first year at the UIT of Lens and is written in C++, using the SFML API.
The goal was to recreate the Pacman game and to add some optional features.
Therefore, the game contains an AI for each ghost (based on the original game),an achievement system, some statistics, a hardcore mode, themes and so on.

# Build & Run 
```shell
make && ./app
```
